This is a USB camera which uses the ultra-low-power Himax HM01B0 and HM0360 sensors. It's intended to act as an evaluation platform for these sensors; commercially available evaluation platforms don't allow for the use of custom optics.

Please contact me if you're interested in buying one, we might be able to set something up.
